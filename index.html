    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Oh The Places</h1>
    <p> Traveling is my addiction. I found this out in the summer of 2013 when I was fortunate enough to go to India with a group of kids from my high school to volunteer at a Leprosy colony in Chennai, a city on Bay of Bengal in the east of India. I went
      through an amazing amount of culture shock when I arrived, and was exposed to things that would make you shudder. I learned from all those who I was fortunate to help out. I learned that although we couldnâ€™t communicate through words, smiles and
      hand holding meant just as much. Language, it seems, should not be something to stop you from going to a new place. It is important to travel to experience culture and experience things unfamiliar to us. Thus, I blame India for my ongoing addiction
      to the thrill new places, new people, and of course, new food. </p>

      <p> The next year, I was able to backpack a little bit of Europe. We went to in the midst of tourist season, and it was amazing. No complaints. Wine. Pizza. Sunshine. Trains. We also got to go through Anne Frank's home and many MANY art museums where
        I learned so much history without reading a text book. I did this trip with a bunch of old pals and new pals from high school which made it the adventure of a lifetime. </p>

      <p> I spent my freshman year of college studying at Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland. It was terrifying, but I loved it. Living in a big city was a huge ajustment, not to mention I was abroad for my first year of college. But, I made great friends
        with people from all over the world and learned a ton about myself. I also learned how to ask questions and talk to strangers- something I'll cherish for the rest of my life.

          <p>The best part about being in Europe for school was having the chance to hop on a plane and explore a new country on a weekend. I played on a frisbee team and got to travel to Wales and England. One of my best friends who I met over there took
            many adventures with me. We took advantage of cheap plane tickets and hostels and made our way to many cool cities. The perk of doing it during the school year was that there were very few tourists!

      <p>Traveling is all about adventure, and you can't plan adventure, right?  Well, this is true to some extent.  But it is important to know where you're sleeping when you get off the airplane at 10 pm in a foreign country.  My favorite place to do this is <a href="http://www.hostelworld.com">Hostelworld</a>.  It's a website that lets you read reviews and look at pictures of the room you will share with 12 other men and women (to keep it cheap, of course). </p>
      <p>My other favorite site is <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com">Lonely Planet</a>. Here, you can get the inside scoop on what exactly to do when your in the new place and what stuff is really not worth it (not free).</p>
      <p>Lastly, when it comes to booking flights, I really prefer <a href="https://www.googleflights.com">Google Flights</a> because of its simplicity and the fact that it shows all of the airlines- including cheap European companies like Ryanair. It also has an interactive map so you can simply click the countries with the cheapest airfare! </p>

        <h1 style="text-align:center;">About me</h1>
      <p>I currently reside in the lovely Missoula, Montana after transfering from school in Dublin this year.  I'm studying journalism at the University of Montana and have no idea what I'm going to do once I get that degree.. travel? I grew up in Park City, Utah, and have learned that I can't be somewhere too long if there are no mountains.  That's why I like to travel, because you can go see cool places but you get to come home to the best place in the world.  When I am not traveling, which is most of the time because I'm on a student budget working at the local market, I hike, ski, run, bike, and play in the outdoors.  My next excursion will be to Singapore and Vietnam. I'll tell you how it goes.</p>
